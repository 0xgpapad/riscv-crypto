[[zbkx,Zbkx]]
=== `Zbkx` - Crossbar permutation instructions

These instructions are useful for implementing SBoxes in constant time, and
potentially with DPA protections.
These are separated from the <<zbkb>> because they
have a implementation overhead which cannot be amortised
across other instructions.
