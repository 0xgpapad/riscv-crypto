== Entropy Source Rationale

The security of cryptographic systems is based on secret bits and keys.
These bits need to be random and originate from cryptographically secure
Random Bit Generators (RBGs). 


=== Standards and Terminology

As a fundamental security function, the generation of random numbers is
governed by numerous standards and technical evaluation methods, the main
ones being FIPS 140-3 cite:[NI19,NICC21] required for U.S. Federal use,
and Common Criteria Methodology cite:[Cr17] used in high-security evaluations
internationally.

Note that FIPS 140-3 is a significantly updated standard compared
to its predecessor FIPS 140-2 and is only coming into use in the 2020s.

These standards set many of the technical requirements for the RISC-V
entropy source design, and we use their terminology if possible.


[[crypto_scalar_es_fig_rng,reftext="TRNG Components"]]

image::es_dataflow.svg[align="center"]
PollEntropy provides an Entropy Source (ES) only, not a stateful
random number generator. As a result, it can support arbitrary
security levels. Cryptographic (AES, SHA-2/3) ISA Extension
instructions can be used to construct high-speed DRBGs that are
seeded from the entropy source.
====


[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_intro-es]]
==== Entropy Source (ES)

We will only consider physical sources of true randomness in this work.
When they meet certain design criteria, they may be used as Entropy
Sources (ES) for cryptographic purposes.

The specification of RISC-V entropy source requirements is complicated
by the existence of two major, slightly conflicting standards:
NIST SP 800-90B cite:[TuBaKe:18] (<<crypto_scalar_es_req_90b>>)
for U.S. Federal FIPS 140-3 cite:[NI19] evaluations and 
BSI AIS-31 cite:[KiSc01,KiSc11] (<<crypto_scalar_es_req_ptg2>>) used
in high-security Common Criteria evaluations.

Entropy sources are built by sampling and processing data from a noise
source (<<crypto_scalar_appx_es_noise_sources>>). Since these are
directly based on natural phenomena and are subject to environmental
conditions (which may be adversarial), they require features and sensors
that monitor the "health" and quality of those sources. Monitoring
is mandated by both the SP 800-90B and AIS-31 standards. 
See <<crypto_scalar_es_security_controls>> for a discussion about
such security controls.


[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_intro-cond]]
==== Conditioning: Cryptographic and Non-Cryptographic

Raw physical randomness (noise) sources are rarely statistically
perfect, and some generate very large amounts of bits, which need to be
``debiased'' and reduced to a smaller number of bits. This process is
called conditioning. A secure hash function is an example of a
cryptographic conditioner. It is important to note that even though
hashing may make any data look random, it does not increase its
entropy content.

Non-cryptographic conditioners and extractors such as von Neumann's
"debiased coin tossing" cite:[Ne51] are easier to implement
efficiently but may reduce entropy content (in individual bits removed)
more than cryptographic hashes, which mix the input entropy very
efficiently. However, they do not require cryptanalytic or computational
hardness assumptions and are therefore inherently more future-proof.
See <<crypto_scalar_appx_es_noncrypto>> for a more detailed
discussion.

[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_intro-prng]]
==== Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)

Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs) use deterministic mathematical
formulas to create abundant random numbers from a smaller amount of
"seed" randomness. PRNGs are also divided into cryptographic and
non-cryptographic ones. 

Non-cryptographic PRNGs, such as LFSRs and the linear-congruential
generators found in many programming libraries, may generate statistically
satisfactory random numbers but must never be used for cryptographic
keying. This is because they are not designed to resist
_cryptanalysis_; it is usually possible to take some output and
mathematically derive the "seed" or the internal state of the PRNG
from it. This is a security problem since knowledge of the state
allows the attacker to compute future or past outputs.

[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_intro-drbg]]
==== Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG)

Cryptographic PRNGs are also known as Deterministic Random Bit
Generators (DRBGs), a term used by SP 800-90A cite:[BaKe15]. A strong
cryptographic algorithm such as AES cite:[NI01] or SHA-2/3
cite:[NI15,NI15A] is used to produce random bits from a seed. The secret
seed material is like a cryptographic key; determining the seed
from the DRBG output is as hard as breaking AES or a strong hash function.
This also illustrates that the seed/key needs to be long enough and
come from a trusted Entropy Source. The DRBG should still be frequently
refreshed (reseeded) for forward and backward security.


=== Specific Rationale and Considerations

==== (<<crypto_scalar_es_pollentropy>>) PollEntropy

An entropy source does not require a high-bandwidth interface;
a single DRBG source initialization only requires 512 bits
(256 bits of entropy), and DRBG output can be shared by any number of
callers. Once initiated, a DRBG requires new entropy only to mitigate
the risk of state compromise.

A blocking instruction may be easier to use, but most users should
be querying a (D)RBG instead of an entropy source.
Without a polling-style mechanism, the entropy source could hang for
thousands of cycles under some circumstances. The `wfi`
mechanism (at least potentially) allows energy-saving sleep on MCUs
and context switching on higher-end CPUs.

The reason for the particular `OPST` two-bit mechanism is to
provide redundancy. The "fault" bit combinations 11 (and 00) are
more likely for electrical reasons if feature discovery fails and
the entropy source is actually not available (this has happened to
AMD cite:[Sa19]).

The 16-bit bandwidth was a compromise motivated by the desire to
provide redundancy in the return value, some protection against
potential Power/EM leakage (further alleviated by the 2:1
cryptographic conditioning discussed in Section \ref{sec:req-es]),
and the desire to have all of the bits "in the same place" on
both RV32 and RV64 architectures for programming convenience.


==== (<<crypto_scalar_es_req_90b>>) NIST SP 800-90B

SP 800-90C cite:[BaKeRo:21] states that each conditioned block of n bits
is required to have n+64 bits of input entropy to attain full entropy.
Hence NIST SP 800-90B cite:[TuBaKe:18] min-entropy assessment must
guarantee at least 128 + 64 = 192 bits input entropy per 256-bit block
( cite:[BaKeRo:21], Sections 4.1. and 4.3.2 ).
Only then a hashing of 16 * 16 = 256 bits from the entropy source
will produce the desired 128 bits of full entropy. This follows from
the specific requirements, threat model, and distinguishability proof
contained in SP 800-90C  cite:[BaKeRo:21], Appendix A.
The implied min-entropy rate is 192/256=12/16=0.75. The expected
Shannon entropy is much larger.

In FIPS 140-3 / SP 800-90 classification, an RBG2(P) construction is a
cryptographically secure RBG with continuous access to a physical entropy
source (`pollentropy`) and output generated by a fully seeded, secure DRBG.
The entropy source can also be used to build RBG3 
full entropy sources cite:[BaKeRo:21]. The concatenation of output words
corresponds to the `Get_ES_Bitstring` function.

The 128-bit output block size was selected because that is the output
size of the CBC-MAC conditioner specified in Appendix F of cite:[TuBaKe:18]
and also the smallest key size we expect to see in applications.

If NIST SP 800-90B certification is chosen, the entropy source
should implement at least the health tests defined in
Section 4.4 of cite:[TuBaKe:18]: the repetition count test and adaptive
proportion test, or show that the same flaws will be detected
by vendor-defined tests.


==== (<<crypto_scalar_es_req_ptg2>>) BSI AIS-31

PTG.2 is one of the security and functionality classes defined in 
BSI AIS 20/31 cite:[KiSc11]. The PTG.2 source requirements work as a
building block for other types of BSI generators (e.g., DRBGs, or 
PTG.3 TRNG with appropriate software post-processing).


For validation purposes, the PTG.2 requirements may be mapped to
security controls T1-3 (<<crypto_scalar_es_security_controls>>) and the
interface as follows:

* P1 *[PTG.2.1]* Start-up tests map to T1 and reset-triggered (on-demand)
`BIST` tests.
* P2 *[PTG.2.2]* Continuous testing total failure maps to T2 and the
`DEAD` state.
* P3 *[PTG.2.3]* Online tests are continuous tests of T2 â€“ entropy output
is prevented in the `BIST` state.
* P4 *[PTG.2.4]* Is related to the design of effective entropy source
health tests, which we encourage.
* P5 *[PTG.2.5]* Raw random sequence may be checked via the GetNoise
interface (<<crypto_scalar_es_getnoise>>).
* P6 *[PTG.2.6]* Test Procedure A cite:[KiSc11] (Sect 2.4.4.1) is a
part of the evaluation process, and we suggest self-evaluation using these
tests even if AIS-31 certification is not sought.
* P7 *[PTG.2.7]* Average Shannon entropy of "internal random bits"
exceeds 0.997.

Note how P7 concerns Shannon entropy, not min-entropy as with NIST
sources. Hence the min-entropy requirement needs to be also stated.
PTG.2 modules built and certified to the AIS-31 standard can also meet the
"full entropy" condition after 2:1 cryptographic conditioning, but not
necessarily so. The technical validation process is somewhat different.


==== (<<crypto_scalar_es_req_virt>>) Virtual Sources

All sources that are not direct physical sources meeting the SP 800-90B
or the AIS-31 PTG.2 sources need to meet the security requirements 
of virtual entropy sources. It is assumed that a virtual entropy source
is not a limiting, shared bandwidth resource (but a software DRBG).

DRBGs can be used to feed other (virtual) DRBGs, but that does not
increase the absolute amount of entropy in the system.
The entropy source must be able to support current and future security
standards and applications. The 256-bit requirement maps to
"Category 5" of NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (4.A.5
"Security Strength Categories" in cite:[NI16]) and TOP SECRET schemes
in Suite B and the newer U.S. Government CNSA Suite cite:[NS15].


==== (<<crypto_scalar_es_access>>) Security Considerations for Direct Hardware Access

The ISA implementation and system design must try to ensure that the
hardware-software interface minimizes avenues for adversarial
information flow even if not explicitly forbidden in the specification.

*Depletion.*
Active polling may deny the entropy source to another simultaneously
running instance. This can (for example) delay the instantiation of that
instance if it requires entropy to initialize fully.

*Covert Channels.*
Direct access to a component such as the entropy source can be used to
establish communication channels across security boundaries. Active
polling from one instance makes the resource unavailable to another
(which is polling infrequently). Such interactions can be used to
establish low-bandwidth channels.

*Hardware Fingerprinting.*
An entropy source (and its noise source circuits)
may have a uniquely identifiable hardware "signature." This can be
harmless or even useful in some applications (as random sources may
exhibit PUF-like features) but highly undesirable in others (anonymized
virtualized environments and enclaves). A DRBG masks such
statistical features.

*Side Channels.*
Some of the most devastating practical attacks
against real-life cryptosystems have used inconsequential-looking
additional information, such as padding error messages cite:[BaFoKa:12]
or timing information cite:[MoSuEi:20].

We urge implementers against creating unnecessary information flows
via status or custom bits or to allow any other mechanism to disable or
affect the entropy source output. All information flows and interaction
mechanisms must be considered from an adversarial viewpoint; less
the better.

As an example of side-channel analysis, we note that the entropy
polling interface is typically not "constant time." One needs to
analyze what kind of information is revealed via the timing oracle;
one way of doing it is to model `pollentropy` as a rejection
sampler. Such a timing oracle can reveal information about the noise
source type and entropy source usage, but usually
not about the random output `seed` words themselves. If it does,
additional countermeasures are necessary.


[[crypto_scalar_es_security_controls]]
=== Security Controls and Health Tests

The primary purpose of a cryptographic entropy source is to produce
secret keying material. In almost all cases, a hardware entropy source
must implement appropriate _security controls_ to guarantee
unpredictability, prevent leakage, detect attacks, and deny adversarial
control over the entropy output or ts generation mechanism. Explicit 
security controls are required for security testing and certification.

Many of the security controls built into the device are called "health
checks." Health checks can take the form of integrity checks, start-up
tests, and on-demand tests. These tests can be implemented in hardware
or firmware, typically both. Several are mandated by standards such as
NIST SP 800-90B cite:[NI19].
The choice of appropriate health tests depends on the
certification target, system architecture, threat model, entropy
source type, and other factors.

Health checks are not intended for hardware diagnostics but for
detecting security issues â€“ hence the default action should be aimed at
damage control (prevent weak crypto keys from being generated).
Additional "debug" mechanisms may be implemented if necessary, but
then the device must be outside production use.

We define three specific testing requirements T1-T3. The testing requirement
follows from the definition of an Entropy Source; without it, the module is
simply a noise source and can't be trusted to safely generate keying material.

==== T1: On-demand testing

A sequence of simple tests is invoked via resetting, rebooting, or
powering up the hardware (not an ISA signal). The implementation will
simply return `BIST` during the initial start-up self-test period;
in any case, the driver must wait for them to finish before starting
cryptographic operations. Upon failure, the entropy source will enter
a no-output `DEAD` state.

*Rationale.*
Interaction with hardware self-test mechanisms
from the software side should be minimal; the term "on-demand" does not
mean that the end-user or application program should be able to invoke
them in the field (the term is a throwback to an age of discrete,
non-autonomous crypto devices with human operators).


==== T2: Continuous checks 

If an error is detected in continuous tests or
environmental sensors, the entropy source will enter a no-output state.
We define that a non-critical alarm is signaled if the entropy source
returns to `BIST` state from live (`WAIT` or `ES16`) states. Such a
`BIST` alarm should be latched until polled at least once. Critical
failures will result in `DEAD` state immediately. A hardware-based
continuous testing mechanism must not make statistical information
externally available, and it must be zeroized periodically or upon
demand via reset, power-up, or similar signal.

*Rationale.*
Physical attacks can occur while the device is running. The design
should avoid guiding such active attacks by revealing detailed
status information. Upon detection of an attack, the default action
should be aimed at damage control -- to prevent weak crypto keys from
being generated.

The statistical nature of some tests makes "type-1" false
positives a possibility. There may also be requirements for signaling
of non-fatal alarms; AIS 31 specifies "noise alarms" that can go off
with non-negligible probability even if the device is functioning
correctly; these can be signaled with `BIST`.
There rarely is anything that can or should be done about a non-fatal
alarm condition in an operator-free, autonomous system.

The state of statistical runtime health checks (such as counters)
is potentially correlated with some secret keying material, hence
the zeroization requirement.


==== T3: Fatal error states

Since the security of most cryptographic operations depends on the
entropy source, a system-wide "default deny" security policy approach
is appropriate for most entropy source failures. A hardware test failure
should at least result in the `DEAD` state and possibly reset/halt.
Itâ€™s a show stopper: The entropy source (or its cryptographic client
application) _must not_ be allowed to run if its secure operation
canâ€™t be guaranteed.

*Rationale.*
These tests can complement other integrity and tamper resistance
mechanisms (See Chapter 18 of cite:[An20] for examples).

Some hardware random generators are, by their physical construction,
exposed to relatively non-adversarial environmental and manufacturing
issues. However, even such  "innocent" failure modes may indicate
a  _fault attack_ cite:[KaScVe13] and therefore should be addressed
as a system integrity failure rather than as a diagnostic issue.

Security architects will understand to use
permanent or hard-to-recover "security-fuse" lockdowns only if the
threshold of a test is such that the probability of false-positive is
negligible over the entire device lifetime.


==== Information Flows

Some of the most devastating practical attacks
against real-life cryptosystems have used inconsequential-looking
additional information, such as padding error messages cite:[BaFoKa:12]
or timing information cite:[MoSuEi:20]. In cryptography, such
out-of-band information sources  are called "oracles."

To guarantee that no sensitive data is read twice and that different
callers donâ€™t get correlated output, it is suggested that hardware
implements _wipe-on-read_ on the randomness pathway during each read
(successful poll). For the same reasons, only complete and fully
processed random words shall be made available via `pollentropy`.

This also applies to the raw noise source. The raw source interface has
been delegated to an optional vendor-specific test interface.
Importantly the test interface and the main interface should not be
operational at the same time.

[quote, NIST SP 800-90B, Noise Source Requirements]
The noise source state shall be protected from adversarial
knowledge or influence to the greatest extent possible. The methods
used for this shall be documented, including a description of the
(conceptual) security boundarys role in protecting the noise source
from adversarial observation or influence.

An entropy source is a singular resource, subject to depletion
and also covert channels cite:[EvPo16]. Observation of the entropy
can be the same as the observation of the noise source output, as
cryptographic conditioning is mandatory only as a post-processing step.
SP 800-90B and other security standards mandate protection of
noise bits from observation and also influence.


=== Implementation Strategies

As a general rule, RISC-V specifies the ISA only. We provide some
additional requirements so that portable, vendor-independent middleware
and kernel components can be created. The actual hardware implementation
and certification are left to vendors and circuit designers;
the discussion in this Section is purely informational.
	
When considering implementation options and trade-offs, one must look
at the entire information flow.

. *A Noise Source* generates private, unpredictable signals
  from stable and well-understood physical random events.
. *Sampling* digitizes the noise signal into a raw stream of
  bits. This raw data also needs to be protected by the design.
. *Continuous health tests* ensure that the noise source
  and its environment meet their operational parameters.
. *Non-cryptographic conditioners* remove much of the bias
  and correlation in input noise.
. *Cryptographic conditioners* produce full entropy
  output, completely indistinguishable from ideal random.
. *DRBG* takes in `>=256` bits of seed entropy as keying
  material and uses a "one way" cryptographic process to rapidly
  generate bits on demand (without revealing the seed/state).

Steps 1-4 (possibly 5) are considered to be part of the Entropy
Source (ES) and provided by the `pollentropy` instruction.
Adding the software-side cryptographic steps 5-6 and control logic
complements it into a True Random Number Generator (TRNG).

While we do not require entropy source implementations to be
certified designs, we do expect that they behave in a compatible manner
and do not create unnecessary security risks to users. Self-evaluation
and testing following appropriate security standards is usually needed
to achieve this. NIST has made its SP 800-90B cite:[TuBaKe:18] min-entropy
estimation package freely available footnote:[SP 800-90B Entropy Assessment:
https://github.com/usnistgov/SP800-90B_EntropyAssessment] and
similar free tools are also available footnote:[(In German)
AIS 31-Implementierung in JAVA:
https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Zertifizierung/Interpretationen/AIS_31_testsuit_zip]
for AIS 31 cite:[KiSc11].

[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_noise_sources]]
==== Ring Oscillators

We will give some examples of common noise sources that can be
implemented in the processor itself (using standard cells).

The most common entropy source type in production use today is
based on "free running" ring oscillators and their timing jitter.
Here, an odd number of inverters is connected into a loop from which
noise source bits are sampled in relation to a reference clock
cite:[BaLuMi:11]. The sampled bit sequence may be expected to be
relatively uncorrelated (close to IID) if the sample rate is suitably low
cite:[KiSc11]. However, further processing is usually required.

AMD cite:[AM17], ARM cite:[AR17], and IBM cite:[LiBaBo:13] are
examples of ring oscillator TRNGs intended for high-security
applications.

There are related metastability-based generator designs such as
Transition Effect Ring Oscillator (TERO) cite:[VaDr10].
The differential/feedback Intel construction cite:[HaKoMa12] is slightly
different but also falls into the same general metastable
oscillator-based category.

The main benefits of ring oscillators are: (1) They can be implemented
with standard cell libraries without external components --
and even on FPGAs cite:[VaFiAu:10], (2) there is an established theory
for their behavior cite:[HaLe98,HaLiLe99,BaLuMi:11], and (3) ample
precedent exists for testing and certifying them at the highest security
levels.

Ring oscillators also have well-known implementation pitfalls.
Their output is sometimes highly dependent on temperature,
which must be taken into account in testing and modeling.
If the ring oscillator construction is parallelized, it is important
that the number of stages and/or inverters in each chain is suitable to
avoid entropy reduction due to harmonic ``Huyghens synchronization''
cite:[Ba86].
Such harmonics can also be inserted maliciously in a frequency
injection attack, which can have devastating results cite:[MaMo09].
Countermeasures are related to circuit design; environmental sensors,
electrical filters, and usage of a differential oscillator may help.

==== Shot Noise

A category of random sources consisting of discrete events
and modeled as a Poisson process is called "shot noise."
There's a long-established precedent of certifying them; the
AIS 31 document cite:[KiSc11] itself offers reference designs based on
noisy diodes. Shot noise sources are often more resistant to
temperature changes than ring oscillators.
Some of these generators can also be fully implemented with standard
cells (The Rambus / Inside Secure generic TRNG IP cite:[Ra20] is
described as a Shot Noise generator).

==== Other types of noise

It may be possible to certify more exotic noise sources and designs,
although their stochastic model needs to be equally well understood,
and their CPU interfaces must be secure.
See Section <<crypto_scalar_appx_es_quantum>> for a discussion of Quantum
entropy sources.

[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_cont-tests]]
==== Continuous Health Tests

Health monitoring requires some state information related
to the noise source to be maintained. The tests should be designed
in a way that a specific number of samples guarantees a state
flush (no hung states). We suggest flush size `W =< 1024` to
match with the NIST SP 800-90B required tests (See Section 4.4 in
cite:[TuBaKe:18]). The state is also fully zeroized in a system reset.

The two mandatory tests can be built with minimal circuitry.
Full histograms are not required, only simple counter registers:
repetition count, window count, and sample count.
Repetition count is reset every time the output sample value
changes; if the count reaches a certain cutoff limit, a noise alarm
(`BIST`) or failure (`DEAD`) is signaled. The window counter is
used to save every W'th output (typically `W` in { 512, 1024 }).
The frequency of this reference sample in the following window is
counted; cutoff values are defined in the standard. We see that the
structure of the mandatory tests is such that, if well implemented,
no information is carried beyond a limit of `W` samples.

Section 4.5 of cite:[TuBaKe:18] explicitly permits additional
developer-defined tests, and several more were defined in early
versions of FIPS 140-1 before being "crossed out." The choice
of additional tests depends on the nature and implementation of the
physical source.

Especially if a non-cryptographic conditioner is used in hardware,
it is possible that the AIS 31 cite:[KiSc11] online tests are
implemented by driver software. They can also be implemented in hardware.
For some security profiles, AIS 31 mandates that their tolerances are
set in a way that the probability of an alarm is at least `10^{-6}`
yearly under "normal usage." Such requirements are problematic
in modern applications since their probability is too high for
critical systems.

There rarely is anything that can or should be done about a non-fatal
alarm condition in an operator-free, autonomous system. However,
AIS 31 allows the DRBG component to keep running despite a failure in
its Entropy Source, so we suggest re-entering a temporary `BIST`
state (Section <<crypto_scalar_es_security_controls>>) to signal a non-fatal
statistical error if such (non-actionable) signaling is necessary.
Drivers and applications can react to this appropriately (or simply
log it), but it will not directly affect the availability of the TRNG.
A permanent error condition should result in `DEAD` state.

[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_noncrypto]]
==== Non-cryptographic Conditioners

As noted in Section <<crypto_scalar_appx_es_intro-cond>>, physical randomness
sources generally require a post-processing step called _conditioning_ to
meet the desired quality requirements, which  are outlined in Section
<<crypto_scalar_es_req>>.

The approach taken in this interface is to allow a combination of
non-cryptographic and cryptographic filtering to take place. The
first stage (hardware) merely needs to be able to distill the entropy
comfortably above the necessary level.

* One may take a set of bits from a noise source and XOR them
  together to produce a less biased (and more independent) bit.
  However, such an XOR may introduce ``pseudorandomness'' and
  make the output difficult to analyze.
* The von Neumann extractor cite:[Ne51] looks at consecutive
  pairs of bits, rejects 00 and 11, and outputs 0 or 1 for
  01 and 10, respectively. It will reduce the number of bits to
  less than 25% of the original, but the output is provably unbiased
  (assuming independence).
* Blum's extractor cite:[Bl86] can be used on sources
  whose behavior resembles N-state Markov chains. If its
  assumptions hold, it also removes dependencies, creating an
  independent and identically distributed (IID) source.
* Other linear and non-linear correctors such as those
  discussed by Dichtl and Lacharme cite:[La08].

Note that the hardware may also implement a full cryptographic conditioner
in the entropy source, even though the software driver still needs
a cryptographic conditioner, too (<<crypto_scalar_es_req>>).

*Rationale:*
The main advantage of non-cryptographic filters is in their
energy efficiency, relative simplicity, and amenability to mathematical
analysis. If well designed, they can be evaluated in
conjunction with a stochastic model of the noise source itself.
They do not require computational hardness assumptions.

[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_crypto-cond]]
==== Cryptographic Conditioners

Cryptographic conditioners are always required on the software side of
the PollEntropy ISA boundary. They may also be implemented on the
hardware side if necessary. In any case, the PollEntropy output must
always be compressed 2:1 (or more) before being used as keying material
or considered "full entropy."

Examples of cryptographic conditioners include the random pool
of the Linux operating system, secure hash functions (SHA-2/3,
SHAKE cite:[NI15,NI15A] ), and the AES-based CBC-MAC construction in 
Appendix F, SP 800-90B cite:[TuBaKe:18].

In some constructions, such as the Linux RNG and SHA-3/SHAKE cite:[NI15]
based generators, the cryptographic conditioning and output (DRBG)
generation are provided by the same component.

For many low-power targets constructions the type of hardware AES CBC-MAC
conditioner used by Intel cite:[Me18] and AMD cite:[AM17] would be too
complex and energy-hungry to implement solely to serve `pollentropy`.
On the other hand, simpler non-cryptographic conditioners may be too
wasteful on input entropy if high-quality random output is required --
ARM TrustZone TRBG cite:[AR17] outputs only 10Kbit/sec at 200 MHz.
Hence a resource-saving compromise is made between hardware and software
generation.

[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_drbgs]]
==== The Final Random: DRBGs

All random bits reaching end users and applications must come from a
cryptographic DRBG. These are generally implemented by the driver
component in software. The RISC-V AES and SHA instruction set extensions
should be used if available since they offer additional
security features such as timing attack resistance.

Currently recommended DRBGs are defined in NIST SP 800-90A (Rev 1)
cite:[BaKe15]: `CTR_DRBG`, `Hash_DRBG`, and `HMAC_DRBG`.
Certification often requires known answer tests (KATs) for the symmetric
components and the DRBG as a whole. These are significantly easier to
implement in software than in hardware. In addition to the directly
certifiable SP 800-90A DRBGs, a Linux-style random pool construction
based on ChaCha20 cite:[Mu20] can be used, or an appropriate construction
based on SHAKE256 cite:[NI15].

These are just recommendations; programmers can adjust the usage of the
CPU Entropy Source to meet future requirements.


[[crypto_scalar_appx_es_quantum]]
==== Quantum vs. Classical Random

[quote,U.K. NCSC QRNG Guidance, March 2020]
The NCSC believes that classical RNGs will continue to
meet our needs for government and military applications for the
foreseeable future.

A Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) is a TRNG whose source of
randomness can be unambiguously identified to be a \emph{specific]
quantum phenomenon such as quantum state superposition, quantum state
entanglement, Heisenberg uncertainty, quantum tunneling, spontaneous
emission, or radioactive decay cite:[IT19].

Direct quantum entropy is theoretically the best possible kind of
entropy. A typical TRNG based on electronic noise is also largely
based on quantum phenomena and is equally unpredictable - the difference
is that the relative amount of quantum and classical physics involved is
difficult to quantify for a classical TRNG.

QRNGs are designed in a way that allows the amount of quantum-origin
entropy to be modeled and estimated. This distinction is important in
the security model used by QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) security
mechanisms which can be used to protect the physical layer (such as
fiber optic cables) against interception by using quantum mechanical
effects directly.

This security model means that many of the available QRNG devices do
not use cryptographic conditioning and may fail cryptographic statistical
requirements cite:[HuHe20]. Many implementers may consider them to be
entropy sources instead.

Relatively little research has gone into QRNG implementation security,
but many QRNG designs are arguably more susceptible to leakage than
classical generators (such as ring oscillators) as they tend to employ
external components and mixed materials. As an example, amplification of
a photon detector signal may be observable in power analysis,
which classical noise-based sources are designed to resist.


==== Post-Quantum Cryptography

PQC public-key cryptography standards cite:[NI16] do not require
quantum-origin randomness, just sufficiently secure keying material.
Recall that cryptography aims to protect the confidentiality and
integrity of data itself and does not place any requirements on
the physical communication channel (like QKD).

Classical good-quality TRNGs are perfectly suitable
for generating the secret keys for PQC protocols that are hard for
quantum computers to break but implementable on classical computers.
What matters in cryptography is that the secret keys have enough true
randomness (entropy) and that they are generated and stored securely.

Of course, one must avoid DRBGs that are based on problems that are
easily solvable with quantum computers, such as factoring cite:[Sh94]
in the case of the Blum-Blum-Shub generator cite:[BlBlSh86].
Most symmetric algorithms are not affected as the best quantum
attacks are still exponential to key size cite:[Gr96].

As an example, the original Intel RNG cite:[Me18], whose output
generation is based on AES-128, can be attacked using Grover's algorithm
with approximately square-root effort cite:[JaNaRo:20].
While even "64-bit" quantum security is extremely difficult to
break, many applications specify a higher security requirement.
NIST cite:[NI16] defines AES-128 to be "Category 1" equivalent
post-quantum security, while AES-256 is "Category 5" (highest).
We avoid this possible future issue by exposing direct access
to the entropy source which can derive its security from
information-theoretic assumptions only.
