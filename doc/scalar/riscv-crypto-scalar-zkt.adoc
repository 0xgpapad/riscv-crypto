== Data Independent Execution Latency Subset: Zkt

The Zkt extension attests that the machine has data-independent execution
time for a safe subset of instructions. This property is commonly called
_"constant-time"_ although should not be taken with that literal meaning.

All currently proposed cryptographic instructions (scalar K extension) are on
this list, together with a set of relevant supporting instructions from
I, M, C, and B extensions.


.Note to software developers
[NOTE,caption="SH"]
====
Failure to prevent leakage of sensitive parameters via the direct
timing channel is considered a serious security vulnerability and will
typically result in a CERT CVE security advisory.
====

=== Scope and Goal

An "ISA contract" is made between a programmer and the RISC-V implementation
that Zkt instructions do not leak information about processed secret data
(plaintext, keying information, or other "sensitive security parameters" --
FIPS 140-3 term) through differences in execution latency. Zkt does _not_
define a set of instructions available in the core; it just restricts the
behaviour of certain instructions if those are implemented.

Currently, the scope of this document is within scalar RV32/RV64 processors.
Vector cryptography instructions (and appropriate vector support instructions)
will be added later, as will other security-related functions that wish
to assert leakage-free execution latency properties.

Loads, stores, conditional branches are excluded, along with a set of
instructions that are rarely necessary to process secret data. Also excluded
are instructions for which workarounds exist in standard cryptographic
middleware due to the limitations of other ISA processors.

The stated goal is that OpenSSL, BoringSSL (Android), the Linux Kernel,
and similar trusted software will not have directly observable
timing side channels when compiled and running on a Zkt-enabled RISC-V target.
The Zkt extension explicitly states many of the common latency assumptions
made by cryptography developers.

.Note to software developers
[WARNING,caption="SH"]
====
Programming techniques can only mitigate leakage directly caused by
arithmetic, caches, and branches. Other ISAs have had micro-architectural
issues such as Spectre, Meltdown, Speculative Store Bypass, Rogue System
Register Read, Lazy FP State Restore, Bounds Check Bypass Store, TLBleed,
and L1TF/Foreshadow, etc. See e.g.
link:https://github.com/nsacyber/Hardware-and-Firmware-Security-Guidance[NSA Hardware and Firmware Security Guidance]

It is not within the remit of this proposal to mitigate these
_micro-architectural_ leakages.
====

=== Rationale

* Architectural testing for Zkt can be pragmatic and semi-formal;
_security by design_ against basic timing attacks can usually be achieved via
conscious implementation (of relevant iterative multi-cycle instructions or
instructions composed of micro-ops) in way that avoids data-dependant latency.
* Laboratory testing may utilize statisticial timing attack leakage analysis
techniques such as those described in ISO/IEC 17825 cite:[IS16].
* Binary executables should not contain secrets in the instruction encodings
(Kerckhoffs's principle), so instruction timing may leak information about
immediates, ordering of input registers, etc. There may be an exception to this
in systems where a binary loader modifies the executable for purposes of
relocation -- and it is desirable to keep the execution location (PC) secret.
This is why instructions such as LUI, AUIPC, and ADDI are on the list.
* Floating point (F, D, Q, L extensions) are excluded from the constant-time
requirement at the moment as they have very few applications in standardised
cryptography. We may consider adding D (double precision) add, sub, multiply
as a constant time requirement on those targets that have D -- in case an
algorithm (such as the PQC Signature algorithm Falcon) becomes critical.
* Timing attacks are much more powerful than was realised before the 2010s,
which has led to a significant mitigation effort in current cryptographic
code-bases.
* Cryptography developers use static and dynamic security testing tools
to trace the handling of secret information and detect occasions where it
influences a branch or is used for a table lookup.
* The rules used by audit tools are relatively simple to understand.
Very briefly; we call the plaintext, secret keys, expanded keys, nonces,
and other such variables "secrets". A secret variable (arithmetically)
modifying any other variable/register turns that into a secret too.
If a secret ends up in address calculation affecting a load or store, that
is a violation. If a secret affects a branch's condition, that is also a
violation. A secret variable location or register becomes a non-secret via
specific zeroization/sanitisation or by being declared ciphertext 
(or otherwise no-longer-secret information). In essence, secrets can only
"touch" instructions on the Zkt list while they are secrets.
*  Cryptographers typically assume division to be variable-time (while
multiplication is constant time) and implement their Montgomery reduction
routines with that assumption.
* Zicsr, Zifencei are excluded, apart from specific formats related to Krypto
and timing, to be discussed.
* Some instructions are on the list simply because we see no harm in
including them in testing scope.
* Vendors do not have to implement all of the list's instructions to be Zkt
compliant; however, if they claim to have Zkt and implement any of the listed instructions, it must have data-independent latency. For example, almost all
basic RV32I and RV64I cores (without Multiply, Compressed, Bitmanip, or
Cryptographic extensions) are technically compliant with Zkt. A constant-time
AES can be implemented on them using "bit-slice" techniques, but it will be 
excruciatingly slow when compared to implementation with AES instructions.
Without Zkt there are no guarantees of even a bit-sliced implementation being
secure.

=== Zkt listings

The following instructions are included in the `Zkt` subset
They are listed here grouped by their original parent extension.

.Note to implementers
[NOTE, caption="SH"]
====
You do not need to implement all of these instructions to implement `Zkt`.
Rather, every one of these instructions that the core does implement must
adhere to the requirements of `Zkt`.

====	RVI (Base Instruction Set)

Only basic arithmetic and `slt*` (for carry computations) are included.
