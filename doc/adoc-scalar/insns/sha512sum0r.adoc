==== sha512sum0r

Synopsis::
Implements the the Sum0 transformation, as
used in the SHA2-512 hash function cite:[nist:fips:180:4] (Section 4.1.3).

Mnemonic::
sha512sum0r rd, rs1, rs2

Encoding::

{reg:[
{bits: 7, name: 0x33},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},
{bits: 3, name: 0x0},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs1'},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs2'},
{bits: 5, name: 0x8},
{bits: 2, name: 0x1},

Description:: 
This instruction is implemented on RV32 only.
Used to compute the Sum0 transform of the SHA2-512 hash function.
The transform is a 64-bit to 64-bit function, so the input and output
is represented by two 32-bit registers.

[TIP]
.Note to software developers
====
The entire Sum0 transform for SHA2-512 may be computed on RV32
using the following instruction sequence:

 sha512sum0r    t0, a0, a1 
 sha512sum0r    t1, a1, a0 

Note the reversed source register ordering.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (SHA512SUM0R(rs2, rs1, rd)) = {
  X(rd) = EXTZ((X(rs1) << 25) ^ (X(rs1) << 30) ^ (X(rs1) >> 28) ^
               (X(rs2) >>  7) ^ (X(rs2) >>  2) ^ (X(rs2) <<  4) );
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
