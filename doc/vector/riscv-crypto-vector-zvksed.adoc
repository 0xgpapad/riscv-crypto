=== `Zvksed` - ShangMi Suite: SM4 Block Cipher

Instructions for accelerating single round 
encryption, decryption and key-schedule
functions of the SM4 block cipher.

All of these instructions work on 128-bit element groups comprised of four
32-bit elements.

Systems which implement `VLEN<128` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.

To help avoid side-channel timing attacks, these instructions shall be implemented with data-independent timing.
