[[zvkg,Zvkg]]
=== `Zvkg` - Vector GCM/GMAC instruction for Cryptography

Instruction to enable the efficient implementation of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and
Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC).

[NOTE]
====
GCM is used in conjunction with block ciphers (e.g., AES and SM4) to encrypt a message and
provide authentication.
GMAC is used to provide authentication of a message without encryption.
====

To help avoid side-channel timing attacks, this instruction shall be implemented with data-independent timing.
