=== `Zvkt` - Vector Data-Independent Execution Latency

The Zvkt extension requires all implemented instructions from the following list to be
executed with data-independent execution latency as defined in the 
link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/releases/tag/v1.0.1-scalar[RISC-V Scalar Cryptography Extensions specification].

The data-independent execution latency (DIEL) applies to all _data operands_ of an instruction, even those that are not a
part of the body or that are inactive. However, DIEL does not apply to other values such as vl, vtype, and the mask.
In some cases --- which are explicitly specified in the lists below --- operands that are used as control rather than data
and are exempt from DIEL.

[NOTE]
====
It is important that the _values_ of elements that are not in the body are that are masked off do not affect the execution
latency of the instruction. Sometime such elements contain data that also needs to be protected.
