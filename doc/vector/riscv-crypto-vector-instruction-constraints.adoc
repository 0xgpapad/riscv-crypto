=== Instruction Constraints
The following is a quick reference for the various constraints of specific Vector Crytpo instructions.

vl and vstart constraints::
Since `vl` and `vstart` refer to elements, Vector Crypto instructions that use elements groups
(See <<crypto-vector-element-groups>>) require that these values are a multiple of the Element Group Size (EGS).
Instructions that violate these `vl` or `vstart` constraints will raise an
illegal instruction exception.

// * `vaes*`, `vsha2*`, `vghmac`, `vsm4*`: `vl` and `vstart` must be multiple of 4
// * `vsm3*`: `vl` and `vstart` must be multiple of 8

|===
| Instructions 
| Required Multiple

| vaes*   | 4
| vsha2*  | 4
| vghmac  | 4
| vsm3*   | 8 
| vsm4*   | 4

|===
// | vaes*, vsha2*, vghmac, vsm4*| 4

SEW constraints::
Some Vector Crypto instructions are only defined for specific `SEW`, all other values reserved.

| Instructions 
| Required SEW

// | vaes*, vghmac, vsm4*, vsm3*| 32
| vaes*         | 32
| Zknha: vsha2* | 32
| Zknhb: vsha2* | 32 or 64
| vghmac        | 32
| vsm3*         | 32
| vsm4*         | 32


|===

// * `vaes*`, `vghmac`, `vsm4*`, `vsm3*`: `SEW` must be equal to 32
// * `vsha2*`:
// ** if `Zknha` is implemented: `SEW` must be equal to 32 
// ** if `Zknhb` is implemented: `SEW` must be either equal to 32 or 64 
// * `vclmul` and `vclmulh`: `SEW` must be equal to 64

Source/Destination overlap constraints::
Some Vector Crypto instructions have overlap constraints. Encodings that violate these constraints are reserved. In the case of the '.vs' instructions, for implementations with VLEN â‰¥ 128 (which includes all application processors)  `vs2` refers to a single register. However, in implementations where VLEN < 128, `vs2` refers to a register group of two registers (VLEN=64) or four registers (VLEN=32).

| Instruction
| Register 
| Cannot Overlap

| vaes*.vs      | vs2      | vd
| vsm4r.vs      | vs2      | vd 
| vsha2c[hl]    | vs1, vs2 | vd
| vsha2ms       | vs1, vs2 | vd
| sm3me         | vs2      | vd
| vsm3c         | vs2      | vd


|===

// * `vaes*.vs`: the single register `vs2` cannot overlap with the register group `vd`
// * `vsm4r.vs`: the single register `vs2` cannot overlap with the register group `vd`
// * `vsha2c[hl].vv` and `vsha2ms.vv`: `vd` cannot overlap with either `vs1` or `vs2`
// * `vsm3me.vv`: `vd` cannot overlap with  `vs2`
// * `vsm3c.vi`: `vd` cannot overlap with  `vs2`
