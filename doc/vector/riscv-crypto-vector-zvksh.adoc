=== `Zvksh` - ShangMi Suite: SM3 Hash Function Instructions

Instructions for accelerating
functions of the SM3 Hash Function.

All of these instructions work on 256-bit element groups comprised of
eight 32-bit elements.
The instructions will most efficient on implementations where `VLEN`>=256.
They will also provide substantial benefit on implementations where
`VLEN`=128, but will require an `LMUL`>1 in order to combine elements 
within a register group to form the full element group.
Implementations with `VLEN`<128 might not be as efficient and should
consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically `Zkne` and `Zknd`,
for accelerated cryptographic operations.

To help avoid side-channel timing attacks, these instructions shall be implemented with data-independent timing.
