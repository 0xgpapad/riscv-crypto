=== `Zvkns` - NIST Suite: Vector AES Encryption & Decryption (Single Round)

Instructions for accelerating single round 
encryption, decryption and key-schedule
functions of the AES block cipher.

All of these instructions work on 128-bit element groups.
For the best performance, it is suggested that they be implemented on systems with `VLEN`>=128.
On systems with `VLEN`<128, element groups may be formed by concatenating 32-bit elements
from two or four registers by using an LMUL =2 and LMUL=4 respectively.

Systems which implement `VLEN<128` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.

To help avoid side-channel timing attacks, these instructions shall be implemented with data-independent timing.
