=== `Zvkns` - NIST Suite: Vector AES Encryption & Decryption (Single Round)

Instructions for accelerating single round 
encryption, decryption and key-schedule
functions of the AES block cipher.

All of these instructions work on 128-bit elements, and hence
require that `Zvl128b` or greater must be supported on
the host system. That is, `VLEN>=128`.
Systems which do not meet these requirements cannot support the <<zvkns>>
extension.

// It is _possible_ to formulate these instructions such that they work
// on systems with a narrower `VLEN` (i.e 32 or 64) and use `LMUL=2,4` to
// create inputs which are large enough to contain enough information.
// However, this incurs a large amount of complexity in the instructions
// design and implementation.

Systems which implement `VLEN<128` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.
