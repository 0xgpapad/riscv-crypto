=== `Zvkssh` - ShangMi Suite: SM3 Hash Function Instructions

Instructions for accelerating
functions of the SM3 Hash Function.

See link:https://www.iso.org/standard/67116.html[ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018
IT Security techniques — Hash-functions — Part 3: Dedicated hash-functions] 

All of these instructions work on 256-bit element groups comprised of eight 32-bit elements.
// , and hence require that `Zvl256b` or greater must be supported on
// the host system. That is, `VLEN>=256`.
Systems which do not meet these requirements cannot support the <<zvkssh>>
extension.

Systems which implement `VLEN<256` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.
