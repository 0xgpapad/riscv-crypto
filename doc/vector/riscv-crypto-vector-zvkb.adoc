[[zvkb,Zvkb]]
=== `Zvkb` - Vector Bit-manipulation used in Cryptography

General purpose bit-manipulation instructions which are essential
for implementing common cryptographic workloads securely & efficiently.

The carry-less multiply instructions `vclmul` and `vclmulh` are only defined for `SEW`=64.

To help avoid side-channel timing attacks, these instructions shall be implemented with
data-independent timing.
