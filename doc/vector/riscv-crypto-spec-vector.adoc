[[crypto_vector_extensions]]
== Extensions Overview

The section introduces all of the  extensions in the Vector Cryptography
Instruction Set Extension Specification.

Each of these extensions has a minimum ELEN, and can be built on any base vector extension that
supports that minimum ELEN.

Most of these extensions can be implemented on XLEN=32 designs. However, `Zvkb` requires
XLEN=64 since `vcmul[h].vx` is only defined for SEW=64.

|===
|Extension
|min ELEN
|min XLEN

|Zvkns  | 32 | 32 
|Zvknha | 32 | 32
|Zvknhb | 64 | 32
|Zvkb   | 64 | 64
|Zvkg   | 32 | 32
|Zvksed | 32 | 32
|Zvksh  | 32 | 32
|===

It is recommended that the Vector Crypto Extensions be implemented on a base with `ELEN`
of at least 128. Smaller `ELEN` values could make it hard to efficiently code cryptographic
algorithms. See <<crypto-vector-element-groups>> for more details on the drawbacks of
small `ELEN` values.


All _cryptography-specific_ instructions defined in this Vector Crypto specification (i.e., <<zvkns>>,
<<zvknh,Zvknh[ab]>>, <<Zvkg>>, <<Zvksed>> and <<zvksh>> but _not_ <<zvkb>>) shall be executed with
data-independent execution latency.
That is, the latency of an instruction's execution shall not vary based on the values
of its _data_. To be clear, _data_ refers to an instruction's operands and does not include 
other parameters of vector execution such as those specified in `vtype` and `vl`.
This behavior is the same as described as described in the `Zkt` extension for
scalar instructions. This behavior in these Vector Crypto instructions is independent of the
implementation of the Zkt extension; it does not require that Zkt is implemented.


Detection of individual cryptography extensions uses the
unified software-based RISC-V discovery method.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, these discovery mechanisms are still a work in
progress.
