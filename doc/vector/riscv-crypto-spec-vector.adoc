This document describes the Vector Cryptography extensions to the 
RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture.

This document is _stable_ and limited changes should be
expected.

[[crypto_vector_extensions]]
== Extensions Overview

The section introduces all of the  extensions in the Vector Cryptography
Instruction Set Extension Specification.

These Vector Crypto Extensions can be built on any RISC-V base. However, XLEN=32 implementations
will only be able to provide 32 bit values to the .vx vector-scalar instructions. 

With the exception of Zvknhb, each of these Vector Crypto Extensions can be build on _any_ 
base Vector Extension, embedded (Zve*) or application ("V"). Zvknhb requires ELEN=64 and therefore cannot be implemented on a Zve32* base.

While the Zvkb extension can be built on an Zve32* base, the vclmul[h] instructions will not be
supported in such a case as they require SEW=64.

While these Vector Crypto Extensions _can_ be built on implementations with `ELEN<128`, this will
require code to be written with high `LMUL` values which result in too few register groups
available to effectively code the intended algorithms. 
See <<crypto-vector-element-groups>> for more details on vector element groups and the drawbacks of
small `ELEN` values..

|===
1 - When ELEN=32, the clmul[h] instructions are not supported as they are only defined for SEW=64

2 - When XLEN=32, scalar inputs are limited to zero/sign-extended 32-bit values.


All _cryptography-specific_ instructions defined in this Vector Crypto specification (i.e., <<zvkns>>,
<<zvknh,Zvknh[ab]>>, <<Zvkg>>, <<Zvksed>> and <<zvksh>> but _not_ <<zvkb>>) shall be executed with
data-independent execution latency.
That is, the latency of an instruction's execution shall not vary based on the values
of its _data_. To be clear, _data_ refers to an instruction's operands and does not include 
other parameters of vector execution such as those specified in `vtype` and `vl`.
This behavior is the same as described as described in the `Zkt` extension for
scalar instructions. This behavior in these Vector Crypto instructions is independent of the
implementation of the Zkt extension; it does not require that Zkt is implemented.


Detection of individual cryptography extensions uses the
unified software-based RISC-V discovery method.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, these discovery mechanisms are still a work in
progress.
