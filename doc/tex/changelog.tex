\item[17/12/19] - Initial first version shown to Crypto Task group.
\item[10/01/20] \begin{itemize}
    \item Don't recommend funnel shifts for RV64, 128-bit rotations
          are not common enough to justify.
    \item Change LUT4 instruction. Go for very efficient RV64 instruction
          and split 4-to-2 32-bit instruction. Avoids ternary.
