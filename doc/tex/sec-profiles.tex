This section describes the implementation profiles for the
Cryptography extension.
Some profiles are orthogonal to one-another, and some overlap.
Where profiles overlap, implementations with both profiles must
implement the union of both feature-sets.
Presence of the cryptography extension in any form is indicated
by bit $10$ of the {\tt MISA} CSR.
i.e. Bit ``K'', because ``C'' is taken and ``K'' is for Krypto.

\note{
All of these are yet to be finalised.
The exact mechanism for exposing the Cryptography extension features to
software will likely be defined by the {\tt tech-config} working
group.
