# RISC-V Crypto

*RISC-V scalar cryptography extensions standardisation work.*

---

- **Note:** These instructions are a work in progress. Their specifications
  are likely to change before being accepted as part of the RISC-V standard.

- This repository is used to develop standardisation proposals for
  scalar cryptographic instruction set extensions for the RISC-V
  architecture.

  - The proposals in this repository are based on work done as part of the
    [XCrypto](https://github.com/scarv/xcrypto) project by the
    University of Bristol Cryptography Research Group

- See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md) for information on installing
  the experimental toolchain.
